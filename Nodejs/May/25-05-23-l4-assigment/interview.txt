1.What is sharding in mongodb?
//proces of storing data in multiple machings.
//Total capacity will get increased by adding multiple shards.
//it increase write capacity by splitting write over multiple instances.
2.How you will protect the API?
//We can use JWT token to authenticate or authorizate the api.
3.How JWT flow works?
frontend username/password --> check in database --> Jwt(userid,roles,expirestime)-->
frontend(session storage)--->after each api --> interceptor attached token --> send it to backend--
middleware--verify token 
4.How will handle error in backend?
//express custome middleware error handling 
5.Explain the flow of creating plain api in nodejs 
//import http package 
//inside the http  createServer()
//Inside the createServer() we have request and response object 
//with response.end() we can send the message to frontend 
//using createServer() create listen method to connect with some port.

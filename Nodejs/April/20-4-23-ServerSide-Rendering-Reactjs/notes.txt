Nodejs
1.With Nodjs you can able to develop full stack application 
2.Nodejs can able to return json data as well as html page 
3.Inside the view folder you can put all html files 
4.only register and login user can access directly html files other files it need to come from controller logic 
5.register and login page they can access directyly without following mvc approach 
6.once data is submitted it should follow the routes-->middleware-->controller--models. 
7.Controller will decide and written the response either in json or html depends upon the requirement.
8.to return json we need to use following syntax 
res.status().json()
9.to return html we need to use 
res.status().send() or res.status().render()
========================================================
Reactjs and Nodejs 
1.we can separate client side and server side page separately 
2.from nodejs we only need json data to be send to frontend. 
3.frontend will handle navigation all type of logic in frontend only dynamic data will access from nodejs 
4.This process is very much fast compare to backend rendering html;
========================================================
Reactjs we can deploy in two ways 
1.separately in static server 
2.deploy with the help of nodejs

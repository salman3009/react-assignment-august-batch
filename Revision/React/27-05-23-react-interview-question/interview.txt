1.What is hooks and realtime usage of hooks?
//if we want to use state in functional component we need the useState hooks.
//useState
//useEffect 
//useContext 
//useMemo 

2.What is state in react?
//to rerender the component we need state 
//reactjs will not rerender until there is a change in state value 
3.what is props in react?
//passing value from one function to another function 
//passing value from parent component to child component 

4.What is DOM?
//Document object model
//html/css is static language 
//javascript is dynamic lanuage 
//to communicate between html/css to javascript we need some translater or common approach 
//DOM will help to communicate between html and javascript 
//html tags will be converted into object and it will form tree like structure 
//so object can be access easiy in javascript 
//By using DOM object javascript can able to add,remove,insert and read the html tags.

5.What is virtual DOM?
//copy of real DOM 
//To avoid entire rerendering of DOM object 
//virtual DOM will compare with real DOM only that particular object which is updated will be reflected in real DOM
//To keep track of changing data they using the mechanism called state.

6.What is component in react?
//Component is a set of instruction is written to render small portion of ui 
//component can be made in two ways 
    1.functional component 
    2.class component 

7.How to use state in functional and class component 
//set will consists of two things get,set 
functional component 
const[get,set]=useState()
class component 
get 
this.state 
set 
this.setState()

8.How you will do api call to backend

we can use default javascript package: fetch 
we can use third party package: axios 
Both will return promise 
Both will return in async way 

Fetch:
//it is default package 
//it is supported in all the browsers 
//we have limited features in this method 
//we have to manually need to convert json to object and object to json 

axios:
//we have lot of features available in this method. example interceptor,defaultURL base 
//No need to convert json to object or object to json because automatically axios will take care 
//most popular in reactjs market.

9.what is useEffect()?
//It is lifecyle mechanism
//Depends upon certain scenario this callback function will get trigger 
scenario 1:
//Whenever we are opening the component for firsttime it will get trigger 
scenario 2:
//whenever there is state/props changes happen for particular state which is attached to useeffect then callback will triiger 
scenario 3:
//whenever will leave the component then callback will trigger.
scenario 4:
//any changes happens will trigger the callback function 
syntax:
first argument is callback function and second arugment is the condition 
[],[state],return keyword
real time example:
we need inital api load in scenario 1
========================
Guidelines:
//please concentrate more on functional component.
//props means property or argument.

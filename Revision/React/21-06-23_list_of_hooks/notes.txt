1.How will handle api call in redux toolkit 
2.what is async tunk 
3.How will handle api error,success,pending response 
4.How you will do error handling in api call 
Implementation:

===========================================
Hooks:
1.useEffect 
   1.Data will be loaded whenever html+css part is ready for one time 
   2.Every state update we need to call the function 
   3.When we leave the current component 
Question:
1.What is the use of UseEffect ?
2.What are the condition is available for UseEffect?
3.How you will remove the data like caching before leaving the component?

2.useState 
   //the component will get re-render whenever changes in state happens.

3.useReducer 
   //Similar to useState 
   //Will have multiple actions to update the state 
   
Question:
     1.What is the difference between useState and useReducer 
     //Both are same only difference is will have multiple action before state update in useReducer but in useState directly state updates is there.

4.useContext 
     //To avoid drilling of props 
     //provider and consumer

5.useMemo 
    //To avoid unwanted rendering of business logic for the component when state changes happens 
    //So complex business logic can be taken from cache if renders happen again.
    //Concept of memoization.

6.useCallback
    //Entire Memo we need to do memoization:
    
7.useRef

1.What are hooks present in react 
2.How you will improve the performance
